# ArduinoUnoWeather
Arduino Uno Weather Station

This project will use an Arduino Uno, BME280 and Arduino 1.44 128x128 TFT ST7735 board. 

 

The final product will be a weather station that displays current temperature in Fahrenheit, relative humidity in percentage and pressure in hPa 

 

I used this project as a jumping off point. The code was valuable, however the hardware design was not used. I will have a link for that:
